## Number-Guesser ##

Number Guesser is a game designed to set a range for 2 challengers guess a secret number. 

## Project description: ## 

We built a game where a 2 users can guess a number between 1-100, with the ability for a custom range to be inputted 
for increased difficulty of play. It displays the current guess of both players, then it displays the final results of each 
match in the card UI. After that each card displays the name of the winner and both player’s names. Two inputs set a custom 
range for the random number to fall within, a button updates the custom range for each player: an input field for guessing
the number and an input field for their name. Another button that submits both players guesses, a button for clearing 
the input field which does not reset the random number, a button that resets the game and generates a new random number and 
the clear button is disabled if there is nothing to clear and the reset button is disabled if there is nothing to reset. 
Our game displays both player’s most recent guesses, displays results and feedback for each player’s guess: 
If their guess is too high, it displays the error 
message: “That’s too high”, If their guess is too low, it displays the error 
message: “That’s too low”, If the guess is correct, it displays the success 
message: “BOOM!” and create a new card to display results. 
Finally, both player’s names are displayed, winning players are indicated and the delete button removes the card from page.
